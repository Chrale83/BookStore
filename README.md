# BookStore.Presentation

To run this solution you have to restore the database backupfile "labb1_bokhandel.bak" thats is included.
Restore the .Bak file in for example "Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio".
Then compile the project and hopefully it will work.

-This Project is hardcoded for the SQL server to be running on the same computer

- If not locate the .Cs file in "BookStore.infrastructure/data/model/BookstoreContext.cs"
- and edit it for your liking
